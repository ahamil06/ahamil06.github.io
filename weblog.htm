							Certain information which I wish to keep in mind 
							years from now is more prone to being lost to time 
							than others as is fairly obvious. That being said, 
							there exist certain elements of a home which are 
							most appealing for their practical usage. In my

							Subway tiles spanning the floor to the walls up to 
							the top of bathroom ceilings should be made a 
							priority to install. Both ease of cleanliness and 
							visual appeal stem from these tiles. Ideally, white 
							ceramic tiles of the same kind should be present. 
							Recent experiences I have had with various bathroom 
							configurations too brings forth that which one 
							should avoid in their quarters. Any wallpaper or 
							painted walls have, to my knowledge, been much more 
							prone to the trapping of bacteria and moisture in 
							various pores. The smooth, sealed surface of ceramic 
							tiles is easily cleaned while being functionally 
							waterproof. Steam production from showering and the 
							generally increased probability of water coming into 
							contact with the wall in the bathroom makes these 
							properties most desirable. To my horror, I have 
							recently observed a bathroom configuration which 
							defied my established principles to the greatest 
							extent. This was located in an older Maine home, 
							presumably built in the early 20th century. Although 
							it was but a brief look, I immediately saw the worst 
							of bathroom design. Wallpaper covered the walls of 
							this room, and a fabric cushion was located to the 
							right of the shower, separated by a wall. A window 
							sat behind this seating area. This raised cushion 
							area was elevated by a wooden cabinet. Although I 
							cannot recall what flooring was present with 
							certainty, I believe a wooden floor adulterated the 
							ground. I must make another important note that wood 
							of any kind should be avoided as much as reasonable 
							in the bathroom. Like wallpaper or fabric, wood has 
							no shortage of pores in which moisture and bacteria 
							is caught. If sealed correctly, wood provides no 
							difficulty. It was evident that the wood found in 
							the aforementioned bathroom was not sealed to an 
							extent where moisture is sufficiently halted. At one 
							time it may have, though the years have made 
							necessary another coating or sealant. One who 
							instals ceramic subway tiles in his home restrooms, 
							spaces as close as the installation procedure 
							permits without copious difficulty, will find my 
							advice to be true.</span></p>

							This was the first of my records regarding the 
							various information I wish to archive. Writing 
							conditions were not ideal due to the small scale of 
							this notebook and the need to write in an 
							automobile. This list will be continued on the next 
							page after the next. It must be noted that my 
							writing occurred during the vacation I had with my 
							family in Maine. Some of the information, namely the 
							bathroom with the most abhorrent design, has been 
							recorded during this vacation due to being so recent 
							in memory.</span></p>
